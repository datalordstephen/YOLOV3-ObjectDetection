# YOLOV3-ObjectDetection
This is an implementation of Object Detection with a Webcam Stream as well as an Image. I made use of the pre-trained model weights trained with the COCO dataset.


I was not able to upload the yolov3-weights file as it was too large, but you can download it [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
